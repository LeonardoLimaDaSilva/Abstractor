  "body": "# Abstractor Framework\r\n\r\n# Abstractor.Cqrs\r\n\r\nFramework that provides the basis for the application of CQRS (Command and Query Responsibility Segregation) pattern of architecture, and some common tactical patterns of DDD (Domain-Driven Design ), namely,  Aggregates, Entities, Value Objects, Domain Events and Application Events.\r\n\r\nProvides a generic compensation algorithm that allows that custom Units of Work are implementated in a simplified way through extension points (see Abstractor.Cqrs.AzureStorage module for an extension example for the Azure Cloud Storage service). It implements the AOP (Aspected-Oriented Programming) paradigm, enabling the application composition in a highly decoupled and modularized way, favoring the structuring of a hexagonal architecture.\r\n\r\nProvides logging functionality throughout the framework, enabling the tracking of the entire application lifecycle.\r\n\r\n# Abstractor.Cqrs.EntityFramework\r\n\r\nImplementation of the Generic Repository and Unit of Work patterns for Entity Framework.\r\n\t\t\r\n# Abstractor.Cqrs.AzureStorage\r\n\r\nImplements the Generic Repository pattern for the Azure Cloud Storage libraries. Uses the generic compensation algorithm, implemented in Abstractor.Cqrs module, which allows the execution of transactional operations across multiple containers, tables and queues.\r\n\t\t\r\n# Abstractor.Cqrs.UnitOfWork\r\n\r\nCoordinates and synchronizes the contexts defined in Abstractor.Cqrs.AzureStorage and Abstractor.Cqrs.EntityFramework modules, allowing transactional operations across multiple containers, tables and queues, from the Azure Cloud Storage, and multiple database tables via the Entity Framework.\r\n\t\r\n# Abstractor.Cqrs.SimpleInjector\r\n\r\nImplements the Adapter pattern for the Simple Injector inversion of control container. It should be used as a basis for future implementation of other containers adapters.\r\n",
